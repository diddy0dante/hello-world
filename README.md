# hello-world
just following the tutorial, don't mind me

So as you can probably imagine, I'm really not that good at writing about this random stuff.
I started learning Swift (Apple's iPhone programming language) a few years ago but because I haven't coded until high school again I completely forgot about how to code in Swift. Now (in high school) we learnt some Python. I'm one of the best in my class if you compare our grades (and the teacher hates me lmao cuz I don't work during class and do it all at home), But the very very best in my class is wayyyyyy ahead of me. But he also wants to focus on the networking aspect or whatever you call that. So I'm still the best wannabe game dev in my class I guess... anyway I still look up to the other kid cuz he's been past my current level for years. So yeah I could really learn something from him.
